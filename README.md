  ## Description:
  This project refactors a fictional e-commerce application to use Redux for global state control, paired with a React front end, Node.js and Express.js for the back-end server, and MongoDB for the database. Stripe is used for payments.
  ## Installation:
  Clone the project onto your computer, and `run npm install` in the root directory, in the client directory, and in the server directory.
  ## Usage:
  
  Use the `sign up page` to create a accout to acces the store

  You can then see order history and test the shopping function. When you check out, you will be directed to a test mode Stripe storefront.

  For testing purposes, `4141 4141 4141 4141` can be used as the credit card number with any future date for the expiration date and any three digits for the CVC.
